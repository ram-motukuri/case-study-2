ETL Case Study - Documentation

Source: Case Study Document.pdf

1. Assumptions
---------------
1. Input data consists of customers.csv, products.csv, and transactions.csv.
2. Files may contain duplicates, inconsistent casing, missing values, and variable date formats.
3. Dates must be standardized to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
4. Missing 'region' in customers replaced with 'Unknown'.
5. Negative stock values replaced with 0.
6. Rows missing 'quantity' or 'price' are dropped.
7. Profit calculated as (price - cost_price) * quantity.
8. Centralized transaction table created by joining all entities.
9. Final outputs stored as cleaned CSVs and SQL-ready tables.

2. Cleaning Rules
------------------
Customers:
- Drop duplicates by customer_id.
- Title-case first_name, last_name, region.
- Replace missing region with 'Unknown'.
- Standardize signup_date to YYYY-MM-DD.

Products:
- Drop duplicates by product_id.
- Title-case product_name, category.
- Convert negative stock_quantity to 0.
- Ensure cost_price numeric and non-negative.

Transactions:
- Drop duplicates by transaction_id.
- Remove rows missing quantity or price.
- Coerce quantity, price to numeric.
- Standardize transaction_date to YYYY-MM-DD.

3. Transformations
-------------------
- Join customers, products, and transactions to form central fact table.
- Derived fields:
    * customer_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
    * revenue = price * quantity
    * profit = (price - cost_price) * quantity
- Aggregations:
    * Total transactions per region
    * Revenue by category
    * Top 5 products by revenue
    * Products with margin <10%
- Data normalization: Title Case text, replace NULLs, unify date format.
